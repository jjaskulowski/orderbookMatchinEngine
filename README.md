# Oderbook Matchin Engine in c#
My implementation of code challenge for trading company.
The requirement was to have it one file (due to their environment/compiler).
It took me 4hours sharp from start to finish including time required to read and analyze requirements.
I think the compiler was accepting  c# 7.0 only.
